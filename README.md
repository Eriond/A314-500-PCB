![Board assembled with RPi](Images/WithRPi.jpg)

<P>This repository contains the neccesary files for building an A314 for the Amiga 500's trapdoor. <br>
The Eagle branch contain the original design from 2018-2020, which was made using CadSoft Eagle v.7<br>
This design uses the Altera MAX10 FPGA, and has a serial connection (SPI) with the RPi.</P>
<P>It is suggested that You use the latest/newest available version of the hardware/PCB, as older revisions may need specialized firmware and software, or may even be incompatible with the latest features of the software suite.</P>
